# Scrum But
*ScrumButs are reasons why teams can’t take full advantage of Scrum to solve their problems and realize the full benefits of product development using Scrum.*

A ScrumBut has a particular syntax: **(ScrumBut)(Reason)(Workaround)**


* "(We use Scrum, but) (having a Daily Scrum every day is too much overhead,) (so we only have one per week.)"

* "(We use Scrum, but) (Retrospectives are a waste of time,) (so we don't do them.)"

* "(We use Scrum, but) (we can't build a piece of functionality in a month,) (so our Sprints are 6 weeks long.)"

* "(We use Scrum, but) (sometimes our managers give us special tasks,) (so we don't always have time to meet our definition of done.)"

# Is it worth it?

86% of projects are challenged or failed.

# Waterfall is a misunderstanding from the beginning

*Waterfall was supposedly “invented” by the paper “Managing the Development of Large Software Systems” by Dr. Winston W. Royce in 1970*

> I believe in this concept, but the implementation described above is risky and invites failure.

# Mismatch between the model and the problem
Is a baby a smaller version of an adult?

In the same vein:
* CMM was born by studying NASA, IBM, DoD
* PMBOK was born to manage Bridge construction

Our organizations aren´t like those!!
